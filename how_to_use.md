# How to use Pixquare theme

## Theme components
Each theme can supply all or only one of the components: colors, images, and font. You can choose to apply the entire theme or only specific components of multiple themes to mix-and-match theme.

## Pre-built themes
Themes that are listed in this repo can be downloaded and applied directly within the Pixquare app. You don't have to do anything else to get it to work. Simply going to the theme menu, expand the list of downloadable themes, select a them to download and apply it.

## Custom theme
If none of the pre-builts themes fit your style, you can create your own. To custom a theme, you first need to learn about the structure of a theme [here](./theme_structure.md).

To start, go to Files app, navigate to `Pixquare (or Pixaure Lite)/themes/Custom`. If the folder is not there, you can create it. After that, you can follow the theme structure to create whatever you want. Colors can be customized directly in the theme menu in Pixquare.

## Remove downloaded themes
To removed downloaded themes, you can go to `Files` app, then Pixquare's folder, then `themes`. Here you'll find the list of themes. Delete the folder(s) you want to delete, and done.
